Tiny9 is a set of base libraries used for writing C programs that
may be run in on an embedded system (e.g., on an ARM M0 Cortex) as
well as on Unix systems.

Most of the code is from Plan 9, Inferno, Plan9port, and Russ Cox's
libtask.

Among the changes made are:

Libtask
	- Ported libtask to the ARM M0 Cortex
	- Added Unix domain socket support

Plan 9 libc
	- Ported the Plan 9 time library to be free of Unix dependencies;
	timezone information is hardcoded.
